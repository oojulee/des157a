                Websites and apps need to be mindful of various design elements to ensure accessibility for a wide range
                of users. As designers, our goal should be to boldly remove unnecessary content and simplify forms
                according to priority, thereby increasing user convenience. Eliminating superfluous questions and
                strategically placing simpler ones first can prevent users from becoming fatigued or overwhelmed by
                complex inquiries.

                When websites or apps require diverse information from users during the subscription process, it's
                crucial to keep questions as straightforward as possible and focus on essential points to minimize
                inconvenience. Adjusting the size of each field can prevent confusion caused by unnecessary size
                imbalances. While many websites and apps use dropdowns, checkboxes are often more efficient when there
                are fewer items to choose from.

                Beyond these considerations, designers play a vital role in reducing eye strain for users by effectively
                coordinating color contrast and font size. By implementing these design principles, we can create more
                user-friendly and accessible digital experiences. <a

                Airbnb is one of my favorite websites. On the home screen, there is a space where you can easily enter
                the location, dates, and number of people. I think it's a user-friendly website because you can see
                various recommended accommodations with images at the bottom. <a
