            <p>Modal windows are elements that sit above the application's main window and are primarily used to capture
                the user's attention or display additional information. To ensure that these modal windows do not
                disrupt the user's flow, an appropriate UI is required.</p>

            <p> First, an escape hatch should be provided, allowing the user to close the modal at any time. A concise
                modal title should also be set to enhance user understanding. Buttons should have clear and intuitive
                labels, such as "Close" or "X," and the background should be darkened to create a focused effect when
                the modal is open.</p>

            <p>Since modals naturally draw the user's attention, it is crucial to design the UI carefully to ensure a
                seamless and comfortable experience.</p>

                Websites and apps need to be mindful of various design elements to ensure accessibility for a wide range
                of users. As designers, our goal should be to boldly remove unnecessary content and simplify forms
                according to priority, thereby increasing user convenience. Eliminating superfluous questions and
                strategically placing simpler ones first can prevent users from becoming fatigued or overwhelmed by
                complex inquiries.
            </p>
            <p>
                When websites or apps require diverse information from users during the subscription process, it's
                crucial to keep questions as straightforward as possible and focus on essential points to minimize
                inconvenience. Adjusting the size of each field can prevent confusion caused by unnecessary size
                imbalances. While many websites and apps use dropdowns, checkboxes are often more efficient when there
                are fewer items to choose from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond these considerations, designers play a vital role in reducing eye strain for users by effectively
                coordinating color contrast and font size. By implementing these design principles, we can create more
                user-friendly and accessible digital experiences. <a

                Airbnb is one of my favorite websites. On the home screen, there is a space where you can easily enter
                the location, dates, and number of people. I think it's a user-friendly website because you can see
                various recommended accommodations with images at the bottom. <a

                Websites that rely heavily on images and interactions often engage users primarily through visual
                content. According to the article "10 Integrating Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking
                Skills," users can interact with images by asking questions like, "What's going on in this photo?" and
                by focusing on and commenting directly on the visuals. When used effectively, images can enhance a
                website's appeal and strengthen its visual identity. Photographs alone can captivate users, but their
                impact can be amplified with the addition of effects. For example, clicking on an image might trigger
                new phrases or questions to appear, creating a more interactive experience. However, excessive use of
                images or using incorrect file types can have negative consequences. To avoid this, it is important to
                select appropriate image formats and use them thoughtfully to maximize their effectiveness.
